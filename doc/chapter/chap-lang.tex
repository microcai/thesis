\section{Defination of A Language}
When John Backus, a programming language designer at IBM, came to describe the syntax of his new programming language IAL, known today as ALGOL 58 (1959)\cite{BNF_ALGOL} , BNF was then invented.
However, Donald Knuth argued that BNF should rather be read as Backus-Naur Form, as it is ``not a normal form in any sense,\cite{BNFvsBNF}" unlike, for instance, Chomsky Normal Form.

\subsection{Structure of the English Sentence}
The English sentence is consists of words with certain rules. Every words has its main parts: \emph{subject, predicate and object}.
{\tt Subject} is a nun, or something similar to nun. 
{\tt Predicate} is a verb, or something can act as a verb.
{\tt Object} is a nun, or something similar to nun. 

A nun can be a compound sentence that describe a thing, aka, noun phrase.
Noun phrase is consists of an Adjective(some time possessive adjective) and a Noun phrase. Yes, this can be recursive. 
Verb can also be a verbal phrase. A verbal phrase modified by adverbs is also fine. Yes, this can also be recursive. 

And, BNF is born to support {\bf recursively grammar}.
