\section{Defination of A Language}
When John Backus, a programming language designer at IBM, came to describe the syntax of his new programming language IAL, known today as ALGOL 58 (1959)\cite{BNF_ALGOL} , BNF was then invented.
However, Donald Knuth argued that BNF should rather be read as Backus-Naur Form, as it is "not a normal form in any sense",\cite{BNFvsBNF} unlike, for instance, Chomsky Normal Form.
