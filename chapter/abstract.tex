\begin{abstract}

Real understanding of English text is required by much of tasks such as \emph{Machine Translation}, \emph{NLP\footnote{Natural Language Processing}}, etc. Building Concrete Syntax \mbox{Tree \cite{cst}} is the very first step of the \mbox{understanding} process. This thesis brings you one possible way of building Parse Tree of Natural Language -- English. It employs \emph{HMM based part-of-speech tagging} and \emph{BNF\footnote{Backus–Naur Form\protect\cite{BNF}} based Natural Language Parse Program}.
